<h2>Ph.D. Topic<br/><br/>
<b>Quick prototyping of assistive technology applications for mobile devices</b></h2>

<p><b>Why a PhD at UCLan UK?</b></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Tuition is waived for the three-years (thanks to a sponsorship by UCLan UK)</li>
<li>Be part of a 700-strong community of student researchers and join them yearly in the annual research conference at Preston, UK</li>
<li>Receive your degree from UCLan UK, a World-class research organization.
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>How and when to apply?</b></p>
<p>
The application deadline is 28th June 2013. More information, and the required application forms are available <a href="http://www.uclancyprus.ac.cy/en/research/phd-research-scholarships-at-uclan-cyprus/">here</a>.
The accepted student will start their studies October 1st, 2013.
</p>

<p><b>What is the topic about?</b></p>
<p>
Assistive Technology is utilizing the increasing sensing capabilities of modern smartphones to enable novel AT applications (i.e. apps that assist people with motor disabilities). This project will develop a smartphone-based platform and methodology for quick prototyping of such applications by employing reusable software components.
</p>

<p><b>What else do I need to know?</b></p>

<p>Inventor Charles Franklin Kettering (1876-1958) argued that
<blockquote><i>
''A problem well stated is a problem half solved''
</i></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
He was probably right. Along these lines, this page does not provide a very thorough description of this PhD topic, but rather a rough description of it.
The main goal of this page is to help interested applicants decide if this is something they would like to spend the next 3 years (minimum) of their life working on.
</p>

<p>
The title of the PhD topic is
<b>Quick prototyping of assistive technology applications for mobile devices</b>

As a PhD candidate pursuing this topic you would be expected to:
<ul>
<li>Review state of the art in AT (<i>Assistive Technology</i>) and identify the limitations related to creating quick prototypes of AT apps using commercial components (both software and hardware)</li>
<li>Develop a pluggable mechanism for quick prototyping of AT applications, centered on a mobile device</li>
<li>Develop a description and modeling language that allows the formation of AT apps using an appropriate editor and a plugin repository</li>
<li>Utilize cloud technology to model and implement the AT apps</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Planning</b></p>
<p>
Generally, the first six months are spent at clarifying and finalizing the Ph.D. project title and content, and putting together a detailed plan for the remaining two and a half years.
Students are expected to meet with their supervisors weekly or biweekly, to report progress, seek help on blocking issues, and refine the plan as needed.
</p>

<p><b>Supervision</b></p>
<p>
How do you expect your supervision to be like? The main supervisor would be <a href="overview.html">myself</a>, but you would also be co-supervised by faculty based at UCLan UK. You would also be expected to travel to Preston once a year for a Ph.D. workshop.
</p>

Practically, Matt Welsh's <a href="http://matt-welsh.blogspot.com/2013/04/running-software-team-at-google.html">comments</a> best describe how I would like to supervise:
<blockquote>
''If I were *forced* to go back to academia, I would run my group much more like a software team. We would have a clear set of objectives and milestones; we'd do code reviews; we'd all sit in the same lab together (I'd eschew a separate office except for one on one meetings); we'd do regular performance reviews for everyone (at least quarterly). The expectations would be made very clear about what it would take to be successful. I would no longer allow students to meander in twice a week and get nothing done for months on end until the next paper deadline rolls around. And we'd focus on "shipping", both code and papers. I would quickly kill projects that were not gaining traction. I was pretty bad about that and let some projects drag on for years without any tangible results (mostly because I had a grant and there was no downside, apart from the mental load.)''
</blockquote>
