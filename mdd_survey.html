<title>MDD Survey</title>

<h1>Summary of the classroom-based survey: questions and answers</h1>

<p>This document presents the results of a questionnaire which was filled in by the students of the EPL-429 course at the University of Cyprus. The students attended the course titled 'Context-aware Pervasive Systems' which included lab assignments during which the students were guided to develop context-aware applications using the methodology and the middleware presented in classroom.</p>

<p>A subset of the students have also used an MDD-based approach for creating context plug-ins that they had previously developed manually (i.e., without the modeling tools).</p>

<p>Parts A and B were answered by all 12 students. Parts C and D were only answered by the 4 students who received hands-on experience with the MDD-based approach. For sections A and B, the results of these 4 students are listed inside parentheses (i.e., 'Yes 10 (3)' means that 10 students in total answered 'Yes', 3 of whom also used the MDD approach). This separation is important as the feedback from these students was evidently more credible regarding the comparison of the manual development approach versus the MDD-based approach.

<h2>5&nbsp;Manual versus MDD-based implementation</h2>

D.1 - Which development approach do you think is easier and why?
<ul>
<li> MDD because of high level abstractions
<li> MDD is easier if you are familiar with the tool (faster development)
<li> MDD because of many automations (MANIFEST, Service Descriptor, etc)
<li> Once you get familiar with EA, the MDD approach is much easier (otherwise manual implementation is preferred)
</ul>

D.2 - Which development approach do you prefer and why?
<ul>
<li> MDD for abstractions and platform independence
<li> I prefer the manual implementation because I am more familiar with it (but if I learned to use MDD then maybe I would change my mind)
<li> Manual implementation because the MDD-approach requires that you know the tools very well in order to use it
<li> MDD approach because it is easier (if you are familiar with the tool) and you save time
</ul>

D.3 - Would you apply the MDD approach if you had to develop another plug-in?
<ul>
<li> Yes (all 4 of them)
</ul>

D.4 - How could the manual implementation task be simplified?
<ul>
<li> Automatically generate MANIFEST and Service Descriptor
<li> Automatic generation of standardized functionality
</ul>

D.5 - How could the MDD approach be improved?
<ul>
<li> Automatic generation of the general plug-in schema
<li> Offer even more functionality
</ul>
