No prior programming experience is assumed.</p><p>The module uses a single programming language and programming environment (Java in this case), but develops transferable programming skills by focusing on the fundamental concepts used in the majority of programming languages.</p><p>The following is a list of topics covered in the module:<ul>  <li>    Setting up the development environment  </li>  <li>    Overall program structure and program flow  </li>  <li>    Variables and data types  <li>    Conditions (if/switch statements)  </li>  <li>    Iteration (for and do/while loops)  </li>  <li>    Simple Input/Output (I/O)  </li>  <li>    Methods (functions) and parameters, parameter passing mechanisms  </li>  <li>    Arrays  </li>  <li>    Simple structures (we mention Object Orientation but do not go into too much detail)  </li>  <li>    Program Testing and Debugging  </li>  <li>    Readability and maintainability of program code (e.g. layout, comments, constants)  </li>  <li>    Editor, compiler, debugger and on-line help  </li></ul></p><h2>Learning Outcomes</h2><p>The main objective of this module is to bring students up to speed with basic programming skills.By the end of the course, students are expected to:<ul>  <li>    Understand the core concepts of programming  </li>  <li>    Be able to analyze a problem and be able to propose an approach to create a program that solves it  </li>  <li>    Implement programs that make extensive use of basic programming blocks (statements, conditionals, loops, methods, math libraries)  </li>  <li>    Understand the core concepts and methods of programming (editors, compilers, debuggers)  </li>  <li>    Familiarize with program code readability and maintainability  </li></ul></p><h2>Resources</h2><p><b>Recommended textbook</b></p><p>Robert Sedgewick,<i>Introduction to Programming in Java: An Interdisciplinary Approach</i>,Addison Wesley; 1 edition (17 July 2007)<a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/">online resources</a></p><p><b>Additional resources</b></p><p>Oracle,<i>Java APIs (Javadocs)</i><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/">available online</a></p><p><i>DrJava editor</i><a href="http://www.drjava.org">available online</a></p><p><i>IntelliJ IDEA - Community Edition editor</i><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea">available online</a></p><p><p><i>Learnable Programming</i><a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">available online</a></p><p>Additional material (including lecture slides and hand-outs) will be<a href="http://elearn.uclan.ac.uk">available in Blackboard</a></p><h2>Collaboration</h2><p>Students are encouraged to study and learn in groups. However, individual assignments should be the result of their personal effort (unless group work is explicitly asked).</p><p>As a principle, you should follow <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/100/99au/syllabus.htm#OTHER">Gilligan's Island Rule</a>: you can discuss assignments with your classmates, but you should not take any notes (electronic or not) from these meetings, in order to be able to fulfil your assignment independently using your own undestanding of the lectures and the group meetings.</p><h2>General rules</h2><p>In addition to the general rules of the University, you should also respect the following rules:</p><ul><li>Attending the lectures is mandatory.</li><li>Students should respect the right of their classmates to attend without disruptions or unnecessary interruptions and thus you should not arrive late (or leave early) unless absolutely necessary.</li><li>You are asked to respect the intellectual copyright legislation, concerning copying and using software and books (in electronic or print form).</li><li>Extensions to assignments will not be granted. In exceptional situations, you should consult the <b>Year-1 Tutor</b>.</li><li>Plagiarism is a serious offense. The University uses plagiarism detection software for all assignments and offenders are subject to the University's rules concerning plagiarism. More details about what plagiarism is (and is not) can be found in your MIP, which is available on <a href="http://elearn.uclan.ac.uk">Blackboard</a>.</li></ul>  <div id="footer"><div class="wrapper">    <hr/>    <p><div id='g_footer'><p>	<small>	Last updated: Jun. 11th, 2013 &mdash;	Developed and maintained by <a href="mailto:npaspallis@uclan.ac.uk">Nearchos Paspallis</a>	</small>	</p></div></p>    <div style="clear: both"></div>  </div></div></body></html>
