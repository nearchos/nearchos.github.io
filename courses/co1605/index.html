In exceptional situations, you should consult the <b>Year-1 Tutor</b>.</li><li>Plagiarism is a serious offense. The University uses plagiarism detection software for all assignments and offenders are subject to the University's rules concerning plagiarism. More details about what plagiarism is (and is not) can be found in your MIP, which is available on <a href="http://elearn.uclan.ac.uk">Blackboard</a>.</li></ul>  <div id="footer"><div class="wrapper">    <hr/>    <p><div id='g_footer'><p>	<small>	Last updated: Jun. 11th, 2013 &mdash;	Developed and maintained by <a href="mailto:npaspallis@uclan.ac.uk">Nearchos Paspallis</a>	</small>	</p></div></p>    <div style="clear: both"></div>  </div></div></body></html>
