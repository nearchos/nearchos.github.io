However, individual assignments should be the result of their personal effort (unless group work is explicitly asked).</p><p>As a principle, you should follow <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/100/99au/syllabus.htm#OTHER">Gilligan's Island Rule</a>: you can discuss assignments with your classmates, but you should not take any notes (electronic or not) from these meetings, in order to be able to fulfil your assignment independently using your own undestanding of the lectures and the group meetings.</p><h2>General rules</h2><p>In addition to the general rules of the University, you should also respect the following rules:</p><ul><li>Attending the lectures is mandatory.</li><li>Students should respect the right of their classmates to attend without disruptions or unnecessary interruptions and thus you should not arrive late (or leave early) unless absolutely necessary.</li><li>You are asked to respect the intellectual copyright legislation, concerning copying and using software and books (in electronic or print form).</li><li>Extensions to assignments will not be granted. In exceptional situations, you should consult the <b>Year-1 Tutor</b>.</li><li>Plagiarism is a serious offense. The University uses plagiarism detection software for all assignments and offenders are subject to the University's rules concerning plagiarism. More details about what plagiarism is (and is not) can be found in your MIP, which is available on <a href="http://elearn.uclan.ac.uk">Blackboard</a>.</li></ul>  <div id="footer"><div class="wrapper">    <hr/>    <p><div id='g_footer'><p>	<small>	Last updated: Jun. 11th, 2013 &mdash;	Developed and maintained by <a href="mailto:npaspallis@uclan.ac.uk">Nearchos Paspallis</a>	</small>	</p></div></p>    <div style="clear: both"></div>  </div></div></body></html>
