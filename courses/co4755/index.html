Improvements in wireless networks, hardware technology, and protocols for the provision of distributed services have rapidly increased the capability and popularity of personal ICT (smart phones and tablets, wearable computing devices, etc.). Furthermore, the advancement of sensing capabilities in modern smartphone devices has fuelled the fusion of context-aware features in many popular apps. The enabling technologies provide both technical and user-interface challenges for the software developer. This module explores the underlying technology and extends development skills to produce, release, and maintain software for mobile and distributed environments.</p><p>We cover the following aspects:<ul>  <li>Human Computer Interaction in the era of mobile and pervasive computing;  </li>  <li>Mobile Application Development Lifecycle;  </li>  <li>Mobile Platform Architecture;  </li>  <li>Networks and Security;  </li>  <li>Advanced Topics in Mobile Applications.  </li></ul></p><h2>Learning Outcomes</h2><p>By the end of the course, students are expected to:<ul>  <li>Develop software for mobile applications using a modern development environment;  </li>  <li>Design an appropriate user interface for a mobile application;  </li>  <li>Recommend solutions to the problems arising during the full lifecycle of mobile application development;  </li>  <li>Use relevant literature to investigate and explain hardware and software technology supporting mobile computing technology;  </li>  <li>Critically evaluate solutions to technical problems relating to mobile computing systems.  </li></ul></p><h2>Resources</h2><p>Brian Fling,<i>Mobile Design and Development: Practical Concepts and Techniques for Creating Mobile Sites and Web Apps</i>,O'Reilly Media; 1 edition (August 31, 2009)</p><p>Bill Phillips, Brian Hardy,<i>Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</i>,Big Nerd Ranch Guides; 1 edition (April 7, 2013)</p><p>Josh Clark,<i>Tapworthy: Designing Great iPhone Apps</i>,O'Reilly Media; 1 edition (June 25, 2010)</p><p>Frank Adelstein, Sandeep K.S.

However, individual assignments should be the result of their personal effort (unless group work is explicitly asked).</p><p>As a principle, you should follow <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/100/99au/syllabus.htm#OTHER">Gilligan's Island Rule</a>: you can discuss assignments with your classmates, but you should not take any notes (electronic or not) from these meetings, in order to be able to fulfil your assignment independently using your own undestanding of the lectures and the group meetings.</p><h2>General rules</h2><p>In addition to the general rules of the University, you should also respect the following rules:</p><ul><li>Attending the lectures is mandatory.</li><li>Students should respect the right of their classmates to attend without disruptions or unnecessary interruptions and thus you should not arrive late (or leave early) unless absolutely necessary.</li><li>You are asked to respect the intellectual copyright legislation, concerning copying and using software and books (in electronic or print form).</li><li>Extensions to assignments will not be granted. In exceptional situations, you should consult the <b>Year-1 Tutor</b>.</li><li>Plagiarism is a serious offense. The University uses plagiarism detection software for all assignments and offenders are subject to the University's rules concerning plagiarism. More details about what plagiarism is (and is not) can be found in your MIP, which is available on <a href="http://elearn.uclan.ac.uk">Blackboard</a>.</li></ul>  <div id="footer"><div class="wrapper">    <hr/>    <p><div id='g_footer'><p>	<small>	Last updated: Jun. 11th, 2013 &mdash;	Developed and maintained by <a href="mailto:npaspallis@uclan.ac.uk">Nearchos Paspallis</a>	</small>	</p></div></p>    <div style="clear: both"></div>  </div></div></body></html>
